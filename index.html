I still love them, but have recently found a new wild. It is its own universe. Programing and computing for me was the great unknown. And for the longest time, I didn't think twice about it.</p><p>Maybe because I thought it was too complicated for me and it was out of my reach.  It wasn't until someone explained that computing comes down to inputs and outputs. And programing is just a set of instructions for the computer. Simple right? That's what got me started and excited. But that only opened me up to more questions and led me to more complicated and interesting concepts.</p><p>Now it's not so simple but still exciting.  I take one challenge at a time, which gives me little wins along the way, which makes it all worth it. Currently I am going through the OSSU Open Source Society University, which is a MOOC. I was introduced to the coding wild. Just trying to find my place in this eco system. And have some adventures along the way.</p> </div>
